# data-structures
Implementing data structures for learning purposes.

### Stack
[stack.c](stack.c) implements a basic stack, which is placed into heap. To test the stack with his test-cases, perform:
```
chmod u+x test-stack.sh
./test-stack.sh
```
If you want to change the amount of iterations, change the CYCLES and STACK_SIZE defines in [stack.c](stack.c).
Beware: STACK_SIZE must be bigger than CYCLES.
